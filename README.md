# üìö BCA Resources Repository

Welcome to the **BCA Resources** repository! This is an open-source collection of comprehensive materials for Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) students, including subject-wise PDFs (books and notes), practical questions with answers, and code examples. Everything is organized by semester in dedicated branches, with the `main` branch serving as the central index.

> üîñ This is **not** a comprehensive textbook resource but rather a curated set of my personal collected notes, pdf-material, programs, and learning experiments.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each semester is managed in its own **branch** to keep things organized and relevant. The `main` branch you're viewing now serves as the index and guide.

| Semester | Branch Redirect | PDF Redirect | Practical Q&A Redirect |

## üéØ Goal

- The goal is to provide a one-stop, open-source resource for BCA study and exam preparation, covering theory (via PDFs) and practice (via questions, answers, and codes). It aims to help students from beginner to advanced levels, foster community contributions.

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Click a branch link above or use the GitHub branch selector to switch.
2. In the branch, explore materials folders (e.g., `oops-and-ds/`):
   - `materials/`: Download books/notes.
   - `practicals/`: View questions/answers in markdown and run code files (e.g., .java, .html).
3. Clone the repo locally for offline access: `git clone https://github.com/itzneel05/bca-resources.git`, then switch branches (e.g., `git checkout sem-3`).
4. Practice tips: Read PDFs for theory, then tackle practicals for hands-on learning.
