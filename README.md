# 📚 BCA Resources Repository

Welcome to the **BCA Resources** repository! This collection contains Java programs, practical question sets, and simple project references that I have personally created and studied during my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). The materials are organized semester-wise for clarity and easy access.

> 🔖 This is **not** a comprehensive textbook resource but rather a curated set of my personal notes, programs, and learning experiments.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each semester is managed in its own **branch** to keep things organized and relevant. The `main` branch you're viewing now serves as the index and guide.

| Semester | Subjects Covered | Branch Link |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Semester 1 | Coming Soon | `sem-1` |
| Semester 2 | Coming Soon | `sem-2` |
| Semester 3 | Coming Soon | `sem-3` |
| Semester 4 | Java Programming Language, .NET Framework | [Go to sem-4](https://github.com/itzneel05/bca-resources/tree/semester-4?tab=readme-ov-file) |
| Semester 5 | Coming Soon | `sem-5` |
| Semester 6 | Coming Soon | `sem-6` |
