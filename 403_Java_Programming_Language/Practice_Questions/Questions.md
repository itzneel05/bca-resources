### Inheritance  
- Design a system where multiple subclasses (like SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount) inherit from a base class BankAccount and implement custom methods for each. - SavingsAccount.java
- Design a class Cricketer having data member name and number of matches and appropriate member function to set the values. Derive two classes Batsman and Bowler from Cricketer class with data member total number of runs and wickets respectively. Batsman class is having a method to calculate average run rate and Bowler class is having method to calculate average wicket. Write a program to create two objects and displays information of one batsman and bowler along with average run and wicket. - Cricket_Match.java


### Interfaces  
- Implement an interface that accepts input from the user and processes it in the implementing class. - Userinput_Interface.java
- Create a real-world simulation using interfaces: e.g., an interface RemoteControl with implementations for TV, AC, and Fan. - RemoteThings.java


### Command Line Arguments  
- Create a calculator application that accepts operands and operator (+, -,  , /) from the command line and displays the result. - CalcCommandLine.java
- Write a java program that accepts string from command line and display each character in capital at the delay of one second. - CommandLine_v2.java

### Exception Handling & Custom Exception  
- Write a Java program that prompts the user to input the base and height of a triangle. Accordingly calculates and displays the area of a triangle using the formula (base height) / 2, and handles any input errors such as non-numeric inputs or negative values for base or height. Additionally, include error messages for invalid input and provide the user with the option to input another set of values or exit the program. - TriangleError.java
- Create a program that handles ArithmeticException for divide-by-zero. - Basic_ErrorHandling.java


### String Methods  
- Write a program a menu driven program which will do following operations. Declare a String object named str containing String "We are Full Stack Java Developer‚Äù. | Display length of the String. | Display the first character of each word of the String. | Count total number of white spaces in the given string. | Display the first word in the String. - StringMethods.java
- Write a Java program to input a string from the user and perform the following operations: Convert it to uppercase. | Find the length of the string | Reverse the string | Count the number of vowels in the string - StringMethods_v2.java
- Write a Java program to display string with capital letters which are inputted through command line. Display those string(s) which starts with "B". - Basic_String_v4.java


### StringBuffer  
- Create a menu-based program to perform multiple string operations (append, insert, reverse, delete) using StringBuffer. - Basic_StringBuilder_v3.java

### Threads  
- Write a program that accept Book information like Title, Author, Publication and Price for the N book from the user and display books in descending order with interval of 1 second using thread - Basic_Thread_v3.java
- Write an application that creates and start three threads, each thread is instantiated from the same class. It executes a loop with 5 iterations.First thread display "BEST", second thread display "OF" and last thread display "LUCK". All threads sleep for 1000 ms. The application waits for all threads to complete and display a message. - Basic_Thread_v4.java


### Packages  
- Create package stores. Under it create a class called stock with member variable (item_no, item_name, stock_availible, and cost). Under the default package create a class called sales with field name (qty_sold) and it is the child class of stores class. Write a program to print the current stock of each item and perform addition. - Pack3. Folder

### LinkedList  
- Write a java program that creates Singly Link List to perform create, insert, delete and display node using menu driven program.
- Create a Menu driven program to implement Singly Linked list and perform operation like create, traverse, insert and delete node. - Basic_LinkedList_v4.java

### Others  

- Write a java program to implement matrix addition operation - MatrixOperation.java
- Write a program which will display information of a particular product. Product class have following properties: | Data Members: [ Pr no | Pr_name | Quanity | Price per unit ] | Methods: constructor () - for insertion of a product information. | search ()- which will search information of product, search will be done by product name given by user. | display ()- which will display information of a product. - Basic_Class.java
- Create a Student Class with Attributes : name, rollNo and marks. Implement a method display() to show student details. Create two student objects and display their details. - Basic_Class_v2.java
- Create class EMPLOYEE in java with id, name and salary as data-members. Again create 5 different employee objects by taking input from user. Display all the information of an employee which is having maximum salary. - Basic_Class_v3.java
