# Java Programming Language – Code & Practice Resources

---

These files demonstrate basic to intermediate-level concepts.

  ### Inheritance  

- Write a program that demonstrates single inheritance with one parent and one child class. - Simple_Inheritance.java
- Create a Person class and extend it into Student and Teacher classes. Show inheritance of methods. - Basic_Inheritance.java
- Override a method in the child class and call both base and overridden versions - Overriden.java
- Create a multilevel class structure: Animal → Mammal → Dog and show behavior overriding. - Multilevel_Inheritance.java
- Create two class one is College and another is Course, College class has data member like name, address and contact no, Course class inherit the properties of College class and it has data member like course name, duration, and intake and do the following operation. | Create constructor for base and derived class. | Insert data through derived class parameterized constructor. | Illustrate the use of this reference and Super.
- Display all the information through parent class reference variable. - Basic_Inheritance_v2.java

  ### Interfaces  

- Create an interface Printable with a method print(). Implement it in two classes with different outputs. - Basic_Interface.java
- Write a program that shows multiple interface implementation in a single class. - Basic_Interface_v2.java
- Write a program to create interface area. Create three classes called rectangle, triangle, and square calculate areas respectively - ShapesInterface.java

  ### Command Line Arguments  

- Write a program to accept a name and age from command line and display it. - Basic_CommandLine.java
- Accept multiple numbers from command line and print the largest number. - LargeNumberLine.java
- Write a Java Program to calculate simple interest using Command  line Arguments. - Simple_Interest.java


  ### Exception Handling & Custom Exception  

- Write a program that throws a custom InvalidAgeException if age is less than 18. - Basic_CustomError.java
- Create a banking app that throws custom exceptions: LowBalanceException, InvalidAccountException during withdrawal and deposit operations. - BankCustomError.java
- Write a program that will accept a number from command line and raise a user defined exception if the number consists of odd number of digits. - Basic_CustomError_v2.java
- Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and performs division. Handle exceptions for division by zero and invalid input - ZeroDivision.java
- Write a Java code that handles the custom exception like when a user gives input as Floating point number then it raises exception with appropriate message. - FloatingPointError.java

  ### String Methods  

- Take a string from the user and print it in uppercase and lowercase. - Basic_String.java
- Write a program that counts the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters in a given string. - CountVowel.java
- Develop a program to remove duplicate characters from a string and return the cleaned version. - Basic_String_v2.java
- Write a program that accepts string data. Extract either All Vowels or All Non-Vowels from given Data According to Options Selection. Also Provide an Option to Display Output in Uppercase or Lowercase. - VowelsNonVowels.java
- Write a java application which accepts two strings. Merge both the strings using alternate characters of each one. For example: If String1 is: "Very", and String2 is: "Good". Then result should be: "VGeoroyd" - Basic_String_v3.java

  ### StringBuffer  

- Use StringBuffer to reverse a string entered by the user. - Basic_StringBuilder.java
- Accept a sentence and use StringBuffer to delete all spaces and print the result. - Basic_StringBuilder_v2.java
- Write a Java Program which will read a string and rewrite it in the alphabetical Order eg. The word "STRING" should be written a "GINRST". - Basic_StringBuilder_v4.java

  ### Threads  

- Create two threads using Runnable and display messages from each with a delay. - Basic_Thread.java
- Create a program where one thread prints even numbers and another prints odd numbers up to 100. - Basic_Thread_v2.java
- Simulate a printing queue where multiple threads (representing users) send print requests, and the printer thread processes them sequentially using synchronization. - Advance_Thread.java

  ### Packages  

- Create a package mathutils with a class Calculator. Use it in another class to perform arithmetic operations. - Pack1 Folder
- Make multiple packages: one for student details, another for operations (search, sort) and integrate them. - Pack2 Folder


  ### LinkedList  

- Implement a singly linked list with insert, display operations. - Basic_LinkedList.java
- Add delete and search functionality to the singly linked list. - Basic_LinkedList_v2.java
- Implement a sorted linked list where new elements are inserted in sorted order automatically. - Basic_LinkedList_v3.java
